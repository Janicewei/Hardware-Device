<h4 id="unique-id">How To start a Gasoline Lawn Mower</h4>

<P> Before starting your mower, inspect it to be sure that there are no leaking fluids, 
such as gas or oil, and that the spark plug is properly inserted and has no signs of damage or corrosion. 
Also, check your fuel level and refill if necessary.

Prime your engine. When you prime the engine, you are squirting small amounts of fuel into the carburetor to
 ensure that you get the proper combustion reaction that is necessary to run the mower.

Pull your ripcord. Most gasoline mowers have a ripcord or pull cord that you need to yank. When you do this, it spins the blades and,
 if working properly and spun fast enough, causes a spark from your spark plug, which ignites the fuel in your carburetor. As a side note, 
 most mowers have a safety bar or lever that can be held down against the push bar on your mower. This safety bar must be held down while pulling the cord and during operation.
 If you let go, it will shut off and won’t start unless held down again.</p>

<h4 id="unique2">How To Use a Power Drill</h4>
 
<p>Select the proper drill bit for the material you are drilling. Metal and wood usually can use the same type of drill bit, but masonry bits have a very special design.
Put on eye protection. Hold the drill with both hands perpendicular to the hole you want to drill.
With gentle pressure, push the drill into the material.
If the drill is going into wood, you may need to pull the drill out periodically as the drill bit will probably clog. By pulling the drill bit partially out of the work while the bit is turning, it will self-clean.
If the drill bit does clog (usually from pressing too hard and too fast), then pull the bit out and clean the clog out with a hard material such as a screwdriver or nail.
Drilling through metal can be tricky. The bit may bind as it cuts through the other side. If this happens release trigger pressure immediately. Pull the bit back and slowly complete the cut. Here it is handy to have a reverse feature especially if the bit gets stuck when it binds.
Once the drill penetrates the material you're done.</p>

<h4 id="unique3">How To Change a drill bit</h4>
<p>Now that drill designs are progressing, many people have been able to change out their drill bits without using a chuck key. Though this is convenient, it does require a different process than what is standard for changing bits with a chuck key. Typically you will use a chuck key if you have a corded power drill. However, if you have a cordless model, chances are that you won’t need to use a chuck key can change your bits by using the following method. First you’ll need to loosen the chuck.

To do this, hold the chuck with one hand and the handle of your drill with the other hand. Next, turn the chuck counter clockwise (to the left) to loosen it. This process will enable the jaws in the chuck to open up and let you remove the bit. Before you put it away, examine it to make sure it hasn’t gotten too dull or cracked. Once you’ve made sure that it is still in good working condition, you can put the bit back into your drill kit. Now you can work on putting the new bit in.

Find the right size and hold the bit with your thumb and index finger with the shank facing towards the chuck. The shank is the smooth part of the bit at the end. Once you’ve done this, put the bit into the chuck jaws and then pull it back towards yourself about one centimeter. Make sure that you keep a good grip on the bit after you’ve done this. The chuck jaws will still be loose and could potentially make the bit fall out. Next you’ll want to tighten the jaws back up.

To do this, you’ll want to loosen your grip on the bit and lightly pull the trigger several times. This will help to ensure that the bit is installed into the chuck correctly. Make sure that you squeeze the trigger gently so it doesn’t turn too fast. Once you’ve completed these steps, you should be able to start your work again.

Take your hand off the bit and pull your trigger at full speed to make sure the bit turns properly. You’ll also want to check and see if your drill has a ratcheting mechanism. If it does, you’ll be able to turn it into place by twisting it in a clockwise motion (to the right). This should put you back on track and ready to get back to work.</p>
